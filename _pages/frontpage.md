## Required skills
The workshop will be quite interactive, and you will be asked to code along with the instructor in the terminal or solve exercises in groups. For this, you will need to be familiar with some command line basics. According to your responses, this shouldn’t be a problem for most of you, but if you think it might be, or you’d like to freshen up your knowledge, please work through episodes 1-3 of the [Unix Shell lesson from Software Carpentry](https://swcarpentry.github.io/shell-novice/) before the workshop. If you are familiar with the commands `ls`, `cd`, `mkdir`, and `rm`, then you don’t need to look at this.

## Required tools
You will need three things set up on your computer: 

1. A bash-style terminal (not Windows CMD or Windows PowerShell)
1. git
1. A Python 3 installation, with the pytest module installed.

You may have this already set up. You can check this by opening your terminal (Windows: search for “git bash” in the start menu / Mac: Spotlight search for “terminal” / Linux: Search for “terminal” on your desktop’s application menu) and running the following three commands, one after the other.
```
git --version 
python --version 
pytest --version  
```
If the results look like the picture below (the exact numbers you see on the screen for all these tools may be different to those shown below, but the Python version should start with a 3), you are ready for the workshop.

If you can't find the tools mentioned above, or if the results don't look like above, please install these using the instructions below to get ready for the workshop. 

Take a look at the instructions for your operating system:
- [Windows](_pages/setup/instructions_win.html)
- [Linux](_pages/setup/instructions_linux.html)
- [MacOS](_pages/setup/instructions_mac.html)

As a backup option, you can follow the workshop via Desktop@UCL. Please see [our instructions](_pages/setup/desktop.html).

## Other setup
The workshop will be held over Zoom, so please make sure you have that [set up](https://liveuclac.sharepoint.com/sites/Zoom) and [up-to-date](https://support.zoom.us/hc/en-us/articles/201362233-Upgrade-update-to-the-latest-version) too!

 You will also need an account at github.com for parts of the Git lesson. Basic GitHub accounts are free. We encourage you to create a GitHub account if you don't have one already. Please consider what personal information you'd like to reveal. For example, you may want to review these [instructions for keeping your email address private](https://docs.github.com/en/github/setting-up-and-managing-your-github-user-account/setting-your-commit-email-address) provided at GitHub.

Finally, you may want to read [some useful tips on how to best set up your screen](https://carpentries.org/blog/2020/06/online-workshop-logistics-and_screen-layouts/) for online workshops.

## Help
