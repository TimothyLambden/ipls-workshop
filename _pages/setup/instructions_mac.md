## Bash
You should already have bash (or another terminal) installed. If you are not sure how to access it, search for "terminal" using Spotlight or under Applications.

## Git
You may already have git installed. Check that by typing the command `git --version` on your terminal.
If you don't have git, it will automatically ask you whether you want to install Xcode.
Confirm the installation and you will get git installed.

The version provided by Apple may be a few versions behind, but that's not a problem for this course.
If you want to obtain a newer version, then you canâ€¯[install it with a different method](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/install-git). 

## Python
{% include python.md os="mac" %}
